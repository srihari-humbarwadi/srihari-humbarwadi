### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a _Deep Learning Software Engineer_ at Intel and a grad student at the University of Edinburgh.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
  - _Implementing Panoptic Segmentation for [TensorFlow Model Garden](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/official/vision/beta)_
  - _Implementing Object Detection models in TensorFlow2.x_
  - _Self Supervision for pretraining Image models_
  - _Large minibatch training on TPUs_
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
  - _Optimization methods, Multivariate Calculus and Machine Vision_
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on: 
  - _Implementing research papers in computer vision_
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking to help others with: 
  - _Bugs in Python, TensorFlow1.x and 2.x code_
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:
  - _Deep Learning, TensorFlow, Math_ 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me:
  - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/srihari-humbarwadi)
  - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/srihari_rh)
- âš¡ Fun fact: _I rarely sleep at night_
